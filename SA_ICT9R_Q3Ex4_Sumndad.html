  			<h2 class="text-light">Osaka Castle</h2>
  			<p>This is the beginning of how I started to love the environment in Japan. Their beautiful sceneries and clean streets. It was calming to just walk there and it was tiring actually but at the same time, relaxing. Just imagine walking here while listening to music. As you enter the gate of the Castle, you would see it from a far but you still need to walk a few steps to see it up close. As you take more steps, you would see the beauty of the castle grounds. Beautiful scences, plants and everything in the environment is just perfect.</p>

  		<div class="col-9">
  			<h2 class="text-light">Osaka Aquarium</h2>
  			<p>As you enter this place you would first sea the beauty of the animals in a forrest or a jungle. Then as you admire this place you will see the habits of the animals living here. There are also a lot of sea animals here including whale sharks, various fishes and other sea animals. While walking throught the aquarium make sure to don't have your flash on when picturing. Picturing the sea animals are fine but it may harm them due to the sudden flash. If you look at the maps beside the animals aquarium, you can see that all these animals came from all over the world.</p>

  			<h3 class="text-light">Universal Studios</h3>
  			<p>Make sure when visiting the famous Universal Studios, you already have a ticket there. As soon as the park opens, there would already be long lines. Also make sure to plan out the rides that you want to enjoy. You could experience a lot of rides like the Harry Potter ride and the Minion ride. The two are one of the most rides that are memorable to me. You would instantly feel like a child when you step into the grounds of the Universal Studios.</p>

  		<div class="col-9">
  			<h2 class="text-light">Namba City</h2>
  			<p>The Hotel that I stayed in with my family is at Namba City. Here you can find a lot of shops, restaurants and a market. As you walk through Namba City, you may pass by Shinsaibashi. Shinsaibashi is a place where a lot of people eat and shop. Luxury stores like Channel and Dior can be see here. Small ramen shops around the corner are also seen and trust me, the ramen taste better in small shops than the bigger and elegant ones. You can walk by the shops and buy a lot of luxury things. There is also a place where a more American style shops can be found. Amerika-Mura is a place where you can find cheaper shoes, jersey jackets and bags. When I was at Amerika-Mura, I bought boots and it only cost me about 4k. Namba City has a lot of amusement and entertainment. I suggest booking a hotel in Namba City or at least near it.</p>

  		<div class="col-9">
  			<h2 class="text-light">Nara</h2>
  			<p>Here is a place where you can find deers roaming around. Most of the deers are friendly and you can feed them with biscuits that can be buy near the park. There are a lot of deers than expected. Be careful showing biscuits to them because deers may surround you in just getting those treats. In Nara you can also visit temples and walk around the park. It also has a nice scenery to take note of and picture. This may be the most memorable experience that I experience because the deers have more manners than people. Did you know, the deers would bow first so that they can get biscuits. It was too funny because a deer suddenly ate a part of our paperbag because it thought that it was food.</p></div>
